Glossop Kinder Velo (GKV) is a cycling club based in Glossop, Derbyshire. GKV is affiliated to British Cycling and the CTT. GKV was formed around 20 years ago when two local clubs, Kinder Racing Team and Glossop Velo merged. We organise regular club runs, time trials, a hill climb and a club holiday.

We run regular club rides to suit all abilities. Details are usually posted on our Facebook and WhatsApp Groups before of each ride. You can also talk to the ride organisers and get a feel for what is involved in advance. You are welcome to come and try a few club rides before joining the club.
